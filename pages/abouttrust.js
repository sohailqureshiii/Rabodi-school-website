                There is an old adage, “DREAMS NEVER COME TRUE”, but this is not
                the case when it comes to the growth and prosperity of our
                organization. Start is DIFFICULT. Middle is MESSY. End is
                GORGEOUS. -Robin Sharma (Author) I and the committee members
                were stormed by the thunders of uncertainties with respect to
                the future of our organization. The seek of a divine source was
                begging for a finish line and a destination. The hope and dream
                of our independent premise was being tested. But nothing lasts
                forever…Destiny has better plans for the people with
                perseverance. I was invited for a school program and the school
                was functioning with extremely limited resources under a shade
                and was at it's infancy phase. Hence, I dedicated myself for the
                benefit and welfare of the school to serve the needy students of
                the society. Through persistence and the grace of Allah (SWT),
                that shade turned in a spacious building for the students. I
                thank my Allah (SWT) for helping me in this small service
                towards the society and accomplishing my desire of erecting the
                school building comprising all the modern era amenities for the
                students and the staff. To lead an educational institution is a
                unique experience. I got complete support and encouragement from
                my colleagues in this tumultuous and tectonic journey of decades
                helping the school to bypass all of them. It gives me an immense
                pleasure to see the current brand that our institution has
                established and recognition it has received in Thane for its
                educational, social and cultural activities. Our Alumni and
                Alumnae are playing a vital role for the upliftment and progress
                of the society and the country by their contribution in
                different sectors of the economy. All these accomplishments are
                not the end, there are many goals and ambitions, yet to be
                achieved by the young aspirants of our society. And our job is
                to strive for the continuous improvement of our youths.

                Words are scarce and feelings can’t be penned. Such is my
                situation when I have received an opportunity to write about my
                thoughts about all these toiling years full of hope and
                humility. I began working for this institution as a service to
                the society without any desire for any prestigious designation.
                However, today I am working as a General Secretary, all thanks
                to the management and our respected President for his belief in
                me through the thick and thin. For me, the word Education holds
                a vital place in my life, and I consider it as one of our basic
                necessities. I am extremely fortunate to get an opportunity to
                contribute my efforts in this noble cause. Under this
                organization’s umbrella, our prime focus is to cater education
                to the children coming from the underprivileged sections of the
                society. With this, the participation in social activities too
                is not neglected. Discipline is one of the building blocks of
                our school’s foundation. We teach our students, the principles
                of discipline to cope up with the daily issues of life in their
                school, college and thereafter. The second spot after discipline
                is reserved for moral education. Moral values are the pillars of
                the character of the students and do the right thing in testing
                times. Finally, it is the inculcation of decision making ability
                with practical knowledge which is one of the prerequisites to
                make the students act in a matured and responsible manner which
                we take with extreme seriousness on a daily basis. Before I
                conclude, allow me to share my thoughts and views regarding a
                healthy and comfortable workplace. We have always placed a
                healthy work environment in the topmost hierarchy of the
                pyramid. An organization can never flourish until it allows
                space to it's faculty, students and management to voice their
                opinions and feedback. This freedom of voice and cooperation has
                helped our organization to achieve the strength of unity that we
                cherish today and the same has helped us to cover this long
                distance. We always support them for their creative and eureka
                moment. Special thanks to our dedicated staff and management for
                their immeasurable efforts for the noble cause of education. May
                Allah (SWT) give us strength and wisdom to achieve our mission.
