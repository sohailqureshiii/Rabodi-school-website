                    Scientific temper is of utmost importance for the progress
                    of the society. As the society is made of young individuals,
                    it is our responsibility to boost the young brains
                    capability to think and invent, by providing the best
                    science laboratory facilities. Theory without practical
                    application is not of much value and importance. To get the

                    We are living in an age of Globalization, which is backed by
                    hypersonic connectivity via Digitization. Take a moment and
                    look around yourself, almost everything has been digitized
                    for good reasons. Gone are the primitive days of standing
                    for hours for your native place train tickets booking. Donâ€™t
                    you curse those stressed hours that you spent in the banks
                    just to get your passbook updated to get the bank statement?
                    Or think about the admission form queues after SSC, when you
                    had to visit each college just to get the admission form.
                    Now, things are available and possible on your fingertips

                    What comes to our mind when we think of a source of
                    knowledge which can be touched and felt? Paperbacks and
                    Hardcopies. Books! We do get bucket loaded information and
