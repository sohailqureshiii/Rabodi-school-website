                In loving memory of the esteemed Muhammad Javed Haroon Sheikh,
                the founding member and first president of Rabodi Friends
                Circle, we pay tribute to his remarkable contributions to our
                school. Established in 1974, under his visionary leadership, the
                organization spearheaded numerous welfare, cultural,
                educational, and national initiatives in Rabodi and its
                surrounding areas. Rabodi Friends Circle, nurtured by his
                presidency, evolved into an esteemed educational society. Today,
                it stands as a reliable institution known as Shafi Burondkar
                Primary School and Rabodi Friends Circle High School. The
                unwavering dedication of Mr. Javed Sheikh, along with the
                invaluable partnership of Burundkar Sahib, played a pivotal role
                in the school's growth and development. Mr. Javed Sheikh was a
                person of utmost sincerity, serving as a core member of several
                renowned institutions in Rabodi. His spirit served as a beacon
                of inspiration for thousands of students, teachers, and
                administrators associated with the institution. His selfless
                service, unwavering commitment, and enthusiasm for social and
                community work were truly commendable. Not only was he held in
                high esteem by his fellow countrymen, but he was also a symbol
                of Hindu-Muslim unity and a pioneer of national cohesion. Fluent
                in English and Marathi, Mr. Javed Sheikh effortlessly bridged
                linguistic and cultural gaps, fostering harmony and
                understanding among diverse communities. We pray that Mr. Javed
                Sheikh's noble soul finds an exalted place in Jannat al-Firdous,
                and may he receive the highest reward for his extraordinary
                contributions to the field of education. His legacy will forever
                resonate within the corridors of our school, inspiring
                generations to come.

                The late Qasim Qureshi Sahab, may Allah bless his soul, played a
                significant role in the Rabodi Friend Circle Education Society
                from its inception. He began his journey by being elected as a
                corporator of the Thane Municipal Corporation. Qasim Sahab was
                an active member of numerous organizations in Rabodi, serving as
                the General Secretary of Islami Dini Jamat and Madarsa
                Madeenatul Uloom. He also held the position of Vice President in
                the Muslim Educational and Welfare Association, while actively
                participating in the Police Peace Committee. His dedication and
                contributions were acknowledged with the prestigious Thane
                Gaurav Puruskar, a lifetime achievement award presented by the
                Thane Municipal Corporation. One of his remarkable
                accomplishments was his unwavering commitment to the
                construction of the RFC Primary and High School building.
                Unfortunately, he passed away on the 14th of February 2021,
                after battling a prolonged illness. He was laid to rest at the
                Gen Qabristan in Thane. May Allah grant him a place in Jannah
                and reward him abundantly for his noble deeds. May his family
                find solace in practicing patience and perseverance during this
                difficult time. His exemplary service on the Police Peace
                Committee further demonstrated his desire to foster harmony and
                unity among different communities. The construction of the RFC
                Primary and High School building stands as a testament to his
                vision and determination. May Allah grant him eternal peace in
                Jannah, and may his noble legacy continue to inspire generations
                to come.
